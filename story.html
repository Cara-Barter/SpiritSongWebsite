      <p>My name is Cara Barter. I am a Tsimshian Fibre Artist. I began my wool journey when I was a child, and my mother taught me how to crochet I also dabbled in rug hooking but didn't really stick with either.</p>

      <p>I fell in love with wool in my 30s when I was a student at university. At the University of Victoria First Peoples House, we had a program for Indigenous Women and Children led by Elder, May Sam. May taught us how to process wool from raw fleece into a woven Coast Salish Blanket. Wool became my therapy to help me deal with the stresses of learning about colonization and the chronic pain conditions that became part of my life. I learned: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>skirting</li>
          <li>washing</li>
          <li>carding</li>
          <li>spinning</li>
          <li>dyeing</li>
          <li>weaving</li>
          <li>felting</li>
          <li>knitting</li>
        </ul>
       <p>I was completely<span style="color: midnightblue; text-design: bold";> hooked! </span>  I wanted to learn everything wool! </p>

      <p>When I graduated from university, I started SpiritSong Fibreworks.  I began selling handspun yarns and finished items. SpiritSong was my side hustle while I worked in various office environments, helping support Indigenous organizations and people.</p>

      <p>By 2016, my family'd had enough of city life and wanted a slower pace. We decided to sell our house in Victoria and move back to the Oceanside area. My health continued to present challenges and I was finding it difficult working the 9-5 lifestyle.</p>

      <p>Once we settled in Coombs, I took some business training and started SpiritSong Fibre Studio. I booked myself into local markets and set up an online Etsy shop.
